## Deposit Service
The Deposit Service is an online tool that can be used to transfer digital files to the Library safely and
securely.

Liaise with Cambridge University Library to:
* Decide which records to deposit
* Identify any records containing sensitive or confidential information
* Discuss the terms of deposit/donation including assignment of copyright

contact at the Library can supply a spreadsheet template that can be used for this purpose.
