# Digital Preservation Policy
## 1. Policy overview
Cambridge University Libraries (CUL, the Libraries) include the main University Library (the
Library) as well as its faculty and departmental libraries. This policy outlines how the
Libraries care for their digital collections to ensure these materials can be accessed by
different categories of users, including staff as well as onsite and online readers, now and
into the future.

The Librariesâ€™ digital collection materials are described as follows:
* Digitised representations of physical and analogue collection objects that are
created in-house or externally.
* Born-digital objects that are created by the Libraries, acquired from members of the
University community or external donors, or purchased.
* Metadata that describes individual objects or a group of objects.
* Metadata-only objects.

Ensuring access to digital collection materials is central to this policy. Access not only
demonstrates that appropriate steps have been taken to ensure longevity of these
materials, it also enables users to discover and feed back any errors or missing content so
that library staff can take action if necessary.

The Libraries take a lifecycle approach to caring for digital collections. This means that
activities that help ensure current and ongoing access do not just happen once or at one
stage. They happen when and where needed, and for as many times necessary, from the
time materials are created or acquired to when they are accessed, used, and re-used so
long as they are held by the Libraries.

Besides taking a lifecycle approach, there are core principles that guide how the Libraries
manage their digital materials to support scholarship and enable world-leading research.
These are detailed in Section 4.
