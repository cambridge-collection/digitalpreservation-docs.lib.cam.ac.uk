# Digital Preservation Policy
*This policy can also be [downloaded as a PDF](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.71114) from the University's research repository.* 

## 1. Policy overview
Cambridge University Libraries (CUL, the Libraries) include the main University Library (the Library) as well as its faculty and departmental libraries. This policy outlines how the Libraries care for their digital collections to ensure these materials can be accessed by different categories of users, including staff as well as onsite and online readers now and into the future.

The Libraries’ digital collection materials are described as follows:
* Digitised representations of physical and analogue collection objects that are created in-house or externally.
* Born-digital objects that are created by the Libraries, acquired from members of the University community or external donors, or purchased.
* Metadata that describes individual objects or a group of objects.
* Metadata-only objects.

Ensuring access to digital collection materials is central to this policy. Access not only demonstrates that appropriate steps have been taken to ensure longevity of these materials, it also enables users to discover and feed back any errors or missing content so that library staff can take action if necessary.

The Libraries take a lifecycle approach to caring for digital collections. This means that activities that help ensure current and ongoing access do not just happen once or at one stage. They happen when and where needed, and for as many times necessary, from the time materials are created or acquired to when they are accessed, used, and re-used so long as they are held by the Libraries.

Besides taking a lifecycle approach, there are core principles that guide how the Libraries manage their digital materials to support scholarship and enable world-leading research. These are detailed in Section 4.

### 1.2 Background 

This policy follows Version 1.01 of the Libraries’ Digital Preservation Policy that was written
during a period of significant change in how the Libraries care for their digital collections.
Digital preservation within the University continues to mature, and in October 2020, the
Cambridge University Libraries were awarded funding from the University to establish a
digital preservation service.

The Cambridge University Libraries Digital Preservation Service will be implemented through a five-year programme beginning in Q2 2021. This programme will deliver identified capabilities to support digital collection materials using open-source systems, tools, and standards.

The CUL Digital Preservation Strategy (forthcoming Q3 2021) outlines how this policy will be upheld, both by the Digital Preservation Programme and by other work being carried out by the University Library.

### 1.3 Audience

Due to the range of activities that help care for digital collection materials, this policy has a
broad audience, including library and other Cambridge University staff as well as users from across the University.

It is recommended that new and existing library staff consult this policy whenever it is relevant to their work. This policy should also be consulted as part of setting up and delivering any library and University projects or other initiatives that will result in the creation or acquisition of digital collection materials that the University Library will need to preserve. Examples include the Digital Preservation Programme as well as project applications to external funding bodies.

External parties might also be interested, including:
* Onsite and online readers of digital collection materials.
* Research partners.
* Existing and potential donors of material.
* Existing and potential funding bodies.
* Publishers and other content creators.
* Suppliers of infrastructure and services for digital collection materials.
* The digital preservation community as well as related communities.

## 2. Why digital preservation matters

Digital preservation is an ever-evolving discipline focused on ensuring access to digital materials for as long as necessary.

Similar to physical collection objects, digital collection objects must also be looked after to ensure their longevity. Without the necessary knowledge, skills, workflows, business processes, and infrastructure to manage digital materials, the risk of losing access to them will occur and potentially escalate.

These are just a few reasons why risks could occur for digital materials:
* Hardware, software, and storage obsolescence.
* Human error.
* Storage media failure that could result in bit rot or complete loss of data.
* Institutional change (e.g., change in strategic direction, loss of funding, loss of staff).
* Natural disasters (e.g., flood, fire).

### 2.1 Lifecycle Approach

Activities that enable current and long-term access to digital collection materials are not carried out once or at one stage. They are performed when and where needed and however many times necessary whilst materials are within the Libraries’ custody.

For this reason, the Libraries look across a lifecycle when managing digital collection materials to ensure that appropriate capabilities exist. The Libraries use a lifecycle comprised of the following stages:

Create involves creating digitised representations of physical or analogue objects. This work is undertaken by the University Library’s Digital Content Unit, staff working on research projects or exhibitions, and external suppliers. This stage also applies to born-digital materials created by library staff, projects, and University bodies (e.g., administrative bodies of the University that create official records of University business).

Acquire is the act of taking in digital material from an external source as well as appraisal and accessioning. For the University Library, this could include digital materials acquired by purchase, donation, transfer, or deposit.

Describe involves describing digital objects using different types of metadata—descriptive, provenance, rights, structural, preservation, and technical—that have either been created by a person or system at the Library or deposited with an object.

Ingest packages and transfers digital objects and metadata for submission to systems that process and manage data.

Store involves moving digital objects to their appropriate storage environment. Backed-up, resilient storage is used for day-to-day working, storing objects prior to ingest, providing access, as well as storing preservation copies of files.

Search and Discovery involves readers using metadata to locate or browse digital collection materials.

Access, Use, and Re-use make digital collection materials available to users, both onsite and online. Re-use means our readers can carry out other activities with digital collection materials beyond simply reading, viewing, listening to, or watching them.

Maintain helps ensure current and future access to digital collection materials.

Although not explicitly mentioned as stages, administrative and data management activities will take place throughout.

## 3. Scope 
### 3.1 In scope
#### 3.1.1 Collection materials 
Digitised versions of physical and analogue works as well as born-digital materials (e.g., research outputs, archival materials) that must be preserved can be found across the Libraries. All of the Libraries’ digital collection objects and associated metadata are in-scope for long-term preservation.

The Digital Preservation Programme will develop capabilities4 for digital collection materials held by the Libraries and prioritise those held by the University Library. The Libraries’ collections will continue to grow as new collections are established and materials and formats are added to existing collections. Capabilities will be designed for known use cases, with the understanding that new use cases will be identified and existing use cases will evolve over time.

Prior to ingest into systems, digital collection materials will be kept on backed-up, resilient storage with checksums to ensure the files remain unchanged, and integrity can be later verified. Some digital collection materials will be acquired on handheld media (e.g., hard drives, CDs) that will need to be transferred to this other storage; there are also analogue materials that will need to be digitised. The care of the media and analogue carriers are the responsibility of the collecting or creating area to which the materials belong.

#### 3.1.2 Associated materials 

Digital objects that are themselves not collection objects but provide additional context about a collection object or group of objects and/or aid in the provision of access, amongst other purposes, are in scope for preservation.

#### 3.1.3 Hosted digital materials

The Library hosts and provides access to digital materials owned by third parties. In some cases, these materials are also in scope for the Library to preserve. This type of arrangement is made on a case-by-case basis and the terms and conditions will be outlined in official documentation (e.g., contract, memorandum of understanding).
