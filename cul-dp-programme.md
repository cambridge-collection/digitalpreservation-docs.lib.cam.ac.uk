# Digital Preservation Programme


## About and Background

Funded by Cambridge University, and approved by the University’s Planning and Resource Committee, in October 2020, the Digital Preservation Programme is a five-year programme of work that will deliver organisation-wide change in how the Libraries' digital collection materials are managed.  

The Programme’s scope includes activities found within stages of a lifecycle of collection management for digital materials, and as such it will deliver capabilities to manage digital materials throughout this lifecycle. The result will be the Cambridge University Libraries Digital Preservation Service that will provide sustainable and integrated capabilities to manage digital collections that underpin digital scholarship now and over time.  

## Objectives

* Central place to store and manage digital materials
* Improve end-to-end workflows reducing manual steps
* Migrate to cloud, optimised where possible, reducing operational costs
* Improve search, discovery, and access across digital collection materials
