# Web Archiving

Operational responsibility for web archiving sits within CUL Digital Preservation. 

CUL does not have its own web archive; instead, CUL contributes to the [UK Web Archive (UKWA)](https://www.webarchive.org.uk/en/ukwa/), which is a collaboration between the six [UK Legal Deposit Libraries](https://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/legal-deposit). Under the UK’s Legal Deposit Regulations, the libraries collect, preserve, and provide access to print and digitally published works, including the UK web domain for current and future research use.  

Websites created by areas of Cambridge University community, including the University’s domain, College websites, and library blogs, and by the city of Cambridge community are the main focus for content. Library staff also contribute to collaborative thematic collections.
