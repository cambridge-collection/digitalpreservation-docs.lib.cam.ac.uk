# Archive of Tomorrow

## About 
Funded by the Wellcome Trust, the Archive of Tomorrow is a fourteen month project to explore and preserve online information and misinformation relating to health, including the Covid-19 pandemic, in the UK Web Archive. 

The project is led by National Library of Scotland, with Cambridge University Library, the Bodleian Libraries, and Edinburgh Universtiy Library as partners, and with the UK Web Archive team at the British Library in a supporting role. 

With funding provided by Cambridge Digital Humantities, the project also includes two fellows carrying out research using the collection being built by the project team. 

The project began in February 2022 and will conclude in April 2023. 


## Content 

The Covid-19 pandemic has contributed to a global crisis of information vs misinformation that has played out mostly online.

Government and medical websites have changed on a daily basis as new information emerges, and there has been a massive proliferation of comment on social media and other online platforms about the virus and other health issues.

Clinical advice, data and scientific evidence have been contested, revised, used and misused with dramatic and sometimes tragic consequences, and yet the digital record of this is fragile and difficult to access.
