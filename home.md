# CUL Digital Preservation 

Based at the University Library, Digital Preservation at Cambridge University Libraries is about ensuring that digital materials within collections can be accessed by readers both now and in the future.

This website is the central repository for documentation—including policies, user guidance, and technical documentation—as well as code for the services library staff are building to ensure ongoing access to digital collections.

For information about our research and works in progress, please visit the [CUL Digital Preservation blog.](https://digitalpreservation-blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/)
